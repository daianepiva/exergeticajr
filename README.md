				<p> Wised is a start-up in the energy efficiency sector aiming at empowering homeowners to better manage their electricity consumption. We live in a world where internet is all around us; we have smart phone devices and smart automated cars, but our houses, on the other hand, have still been stuck in the past, not having the ability to interact with us, unless one is willing to spent thousands of dollars in automating home services, with features that one might not even need, that are extremely cost and does not help on saving.</p>

			<h4 style="color:#0080FF"> The Problem </h4>

				<p>In 2015, the electricity price in the state of Parana, Brazil, increased by a factor of over 51%. In Brazil, the average electricity price increase for residential clients was of 31% according to the Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency, ANEEL.</p>

				<p>You can learn more about the Brazilian energy market by clicking <a href="http://www.aneel.gov.br/?idiomaAtual=1"> here </a> </p>

			<h4 style="color:#0080FF"> The Solution</h4>
			
				<p>Worried about this situation, some students at the Federal University of Latin america, in Brazil, decided to take action and create an enterprise that would take the classroom knowledge and start applying it to solve real-life issues. Exergetica Jr was founded in 2014 and since then, it has helped small business and local farmers to implement simple, yet efficient, actions to decrease their energy consumption. </p>
